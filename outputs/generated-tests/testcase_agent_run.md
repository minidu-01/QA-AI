# Test Case Agent Run Summary

**Input:** `outputs/impact-analysis/impact_report.md`  
**Additional input:** `inputs/testcases/` (not present)

---

## Result

**No test cases generated or updated.**

Per agent instruction: *"Generate test cases ONLY where required."*

The impact report identified one candidate for impact analysis: **seer-dev/package-lock.json** (NO REQUIREMENT). For that item:

- **Test Case Update Required:** No  
- **New Test Coverage Required:** No  

No existing test cases were supplied under `inputs/testcases/`. Therefore no test case generation or update was performed.

## Output

No new or updated CSV files were written to `outputs/generated-tests/` for this run. Existing files (e.g. `login_test_cases.csv`) were left unchanged.
